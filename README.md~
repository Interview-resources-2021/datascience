# Data Science Portfolio and Python Machine Learning

This is a repository of the projects I attempt or currently working on. It is updated regularly.The projects are mostly written in Jupyte Notebooks but sometimes I use VIM for quick edits.

The idea is to expose myself to various domains of datascienc and statistics modelling techniques.
General pipline flow is 
* Finding and Cleaning Data
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Deriving Conclusion

 Not all code is my original as I take lot of inspiration from books, online blogs, internet articles and videos.

```
