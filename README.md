# Data Science Portfolio and Python Machine Learning

This is a repository of the projects I attempt or currently working on. It is updated regularly.The projects are mostly written in Jupyter Notebooks but sometimes I use VIM for quick edits.

The idea is to get exposure to various domains of datascience and statistics modelling techniques.

General pipeline flow is 

* Finding and Cleaning Data
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Deriving Conclusion

 Most of the code is inspired from Hands on Data Science by Frank Kane but I would add other exercises here as well which I explore on online blogs, internet articles and videos.


## Instructions and Navigation


```
import numpy as np
 
import pandas as pd
 
from sklearn import tree

 
input_file = files are part of the repository. If you clone you can download and add the relative paths.

```
