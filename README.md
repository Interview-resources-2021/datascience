# Data Science Portfolio

This is a repository of projects or exercises I've attempted on various aspects of datascience.
The idea is to get exposure to various domains of datascience and statistics modelling techniques.

General pipeline flow is 

* Finding and Cleaning Data
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Deriving Conclusion

 
### Note of Thanks

I would like to thank authors of various books especially Aurélien Géron and Frank Kane their wonderful books on Handson DataScience and Machine Learning with ScikitLearn and TensorFlow. I highly recommend both of these books.
